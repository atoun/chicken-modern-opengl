chicken-modern-opengl
=====================

Uhh, so, I'm porting [this](http://duriansoftware.com/joe/An-intro-to-modern-OpenGL.-Chapter-2:-Hello-World:-The-Slideshow.html) to Chicken Scheme.

I had some weird hiccups with stuff and I make no promises that I did 
things the kosher way. Maybe it'll be useful to you? Maybe not.
